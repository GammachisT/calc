## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a functional and user-friendly calculator application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app aims to provide users with an intuitive interface for performing basic arithmetic and scientific calculations as well as temperature convertor. By integrating both standard and scientific functions, the calculator serves a wide range of users, from students needing quick calculations to professionals requiring advanced mathematical tools.
## Team Members, Roles, and Timeline
I did all thing lonely
**Timeline:** - **Week 1**: Project planning and initial design mockups. - **Week 2**: Development of the basic calculator functions and layout. -** Week 3**: Implementation of scientific functions and error handling. Testing, bug fixing, and preparing for deployment.
## Target Audience
The calculator app was created for a broad audience, including:- **Students:** Individuals needing a reliable tool for math homework and study.- **Professionals:** Workers in fields such as engineering, finance, and science who require quick and accurate calculations.- **General Users:** Anyone looking for a simple, accessible calculator for everyday use.
## Personal Focus
My personal focus during this project was on developing the core functionality of the calculator, particularly the implementation of both basic and scientific functions and temperature convertion. I aimed to ensure that the app was not only functional but also intuitive to use. Additionally, I concentrated on writing clean and maintainable code, as well as implementing effective error handling to enhance user experience. Throughout the project, I also prioritized responsive design, ensuring that the calculator would be usable across devices, from desktops to smartphones.
